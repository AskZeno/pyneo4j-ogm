# Neo4j Object Graph Mapper for Python
A asynchronous library for working with Neo4j and Python 3.10+. This library aims to solve the problem of repeating the same queries over and over again by providing a simple way to define your models and their relationships. It is built on top of the [`Neo4j Python Driver`](https://neo4j.com/docs/api/python-driver/current/index.html) and [`pydantic 1.10`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/1.10/).


## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start <a name="quick-start"></a>
Before we can start to interact with our database, we have to take care of some setup. First, we have to connect to our database with the `connect()` method from the `Neo4jClient` class. This can be done by creating a new instance of the `Neo4jClient` class and passing the connection details as keyword arguments. This class is our entry point to the library and will be used to interact with our database.

```python
from pyneo4j_ogm import Neo4jClient

# Initialize the client class and call the `.connect()` method
client = Neo4jClient()
client.connect(uri="<connection-uri-to-database>", auth=("<username>", "<password>"))

# The `.connect()` allows to be chained right after the instantiation of the class
# for more convenience.
client = Neo4jClient().connect(uri="<connection-uri-to-database>", auth=("<username>", "<password>"))
```

Next, we need to define our models. Models are used to represent data in our database. They are defined by inheriting from either the `NodeModel` or `RelationshipModel` class, depending on the type of graph entity we want our data to represent. Let's create a `Developer` who `DRINKS` some `Coffee`:

```python
from pyneo4j_ogm import (
  NodeModel,
  RelationshipModel,
  RelationshipProperty,
  RelationshipPropertyDirection,
  RelationshipPropertyCardinality
)


class Developer(NodeModel):
  """
  A model representing a developer node in the graph.
  """
  name: str
  age: int

  coffee: RelationshipProperty["Coffee", "Drinks"] = RelationshipProperty(
    target_model="Coffee",
    relationship_model="Drinks",
    direction=RelationshipPropertyDirection.OUTGOING,
    cardinality=RelationshipPropertyCardinality.ZERO_OR_MORE,
    allow_multiple=True,
  )


class Coffee(NodeModel):
  """
  A model representing a coffee node in the graph.
  """
  name: str


class Drinks(RelationshipModel):
  """
  A model representing a DRINKS relationship between a developer and a coffee node.
  """
  likes_it: bool
```

Now that we have our models defined, we have to let our client know about them. This can be done by calling the `register_models()` method of the `Neo4jClient` class and passing our models as a list.

```python
# Client initialization and model definition happened here ...

# Register the models with the client
await client.register_models([Developer, Coffee, Drinks])
```

> **Note**: This step can be skipped in certain cases, but it is recommended to always register your models with the client. Skipping this step will result in you loosing a big portion of the library's functionality (Like working with your models).

Finally, we can start to work with our database. Let's create a new `Developer` node and a `Coffee` node and connect them with a `DRINKS` relationship.

```python
# Create a new developer node
developer = await Developer.create(name="John Doe", age=25)

# Create a new coffee node
coffee = await Coffee.create(name="Espresso")

# Connect the developer and coffee nodes with a DRINKS relationship
await developer.coffee.connect(coffee, likes_it=True)
```

So if we put it all together, our code should look something like this:

```python
import asyncio

from pyneo4j_ogm import (
  Neo4jClient,
  NodeModel,
  RelationshipModel,
  RelationshipProperty,
  RelationshipPropertyDirection,
  RelationshipPropertyCardinality
)


class Developer(NodeModel):
  """
  A model representing a developer node in the graph.
  """
  name: str
  age: int

  coffee: RelationshipProperty["Coffee", "Drinks"] = RelationshipProperty(
    target_model="Coffee",
    relationship_model="Drinks",
    direction=RelationshipPropertyDirection.OUTGOING,
    cardinality=RelationshipPropertyCardinality.ZERO_OR_MORE,
    allow_multiple=True,
  )


class Coffee(NodeModel):
  """
  A model representing a coffee node in the graph.
  """
  name: str


class Drinks(RelationshipModel):
  """
  A model representing a DRINKS relationship between a developer and a coffee node.
  """
  likes_it: bool


async def main():
  # Connect to the database and register the models
  client = Neo4jClient().connect(uri="<connection-uri-to-database>", auth=("<username>", "<password>"))
  await client.register_models([Developer, Coffee, Drinks])

  # Create new developer and coffee nodes and connect them with a DRINKS relationship
  developer = await Developer(name="John Doe", age=25).create()
  coffee = await Coffee(name="Espresso").create()

  await developer.coffee.connect(coffee, {"likes_it": True})

  # Close connection again
  await client.close()

# Run the main function
asyncio.run(main())
```

> **Note**: This script should run `as is`. You mus change the `uri` and `auth` parameters in the `connect()` method call to match the ones needed for your own database before starting the script.

### Basic concepts <a name="basic-concepts"></a>
If you have worked with other ORM's like `sqlalchemy` or `beanie` before, you will find that this library is very similar to them. The main idea is to work with nodes and relationships in a **structured and easy-to-use** way instead of writing out complex cypher queries and tons of boilerplate for simple operations.

The concept of this library builds on the idea of defining nodes and relationships present in the graph database as **Python classes**. This allows for easy and structured access to the data. These classes provide a robust foundation for working with a Neo4j database using methods for common queries, a filter API, model resolution and more.

In the following sections we will take a look at all of the features of this library and how to use them.

> **Note:** All of the examples in this documentation assume that you have already connected to a database instance and registered your models with the client instance. The models used in the following examples will build upon the ones defined in the [`Quick start`](#quick-start) section.


### Database client <a name="database-client"></a>
The `Neo4jClient` class is the brains of the library. It is used to connect to a database instance, register models and execute queries. Under the hood, every class uses the client to execute queries. It is also possible to use multiple client instances to connect to multiple databases at the same time by initializing multiple instances of the `Neo4jClient` class.


#### Connecting to a database instance <a name="connecting-to-a-database-instance"></a>
Before you can interact with anything this library offers in any way, you have to connect to a database. You can do this by creating a new instance of the `Neo4jClient` class and calling the `connect()` method on it. The `connect()` method takes a few arguments:

- `uri`: The connection URI to the database instance.
- `skip_constraints`: Whether the client should skip creating any constraints defined on models when registering them. Defaults to `False`.
- `skip_indexes`: Whether the client should skip creating any indexes defined on models when registering them. Defaults to `False`.
- `*args`: Additional arguments that are passed directly to Neo4j's `AsyncDriver.driver()` method.
- `**kwargs`: Additional keyword arguments that are passed directly to Neo4j's `AsyncDriver.driver()` method.

The `connect()` method returns the client instance itself, so you can chain it right after the instantiation of the class. Here is an example of how to connect to a database instance:

```python
from pyneo4j_ogm import Neo4jClient

client = Neo4jClient()
client.connect(uri="<connection-uri-to-database>", auth=("<username>", "<password>"), max_connection_pool_size=10, ...)

# Or chained right after the instantiation of the class
client = Neo4jClient().connect(uri="<connection-uri-to-database>", auth=("<username>", "<password>"), max_connection_pool_size=10, ...)
```

After connecting the client, you will be able to run queries against the database. Should you try to run a query without connecting to a database instance first, you will get a `NotConnectedToDatabase` exception.


#### Closing an existing connection <a name="closing-an-existing-connection"></a>
Once you are done working with a database and the client is no longer needed, you can close the connection to it by calling the `close()` method on the client instance. This will close the connection to the database and free up any resources used by the client. Here is an example of how to close a connection to a database instance:

```python
# Do some work with the database instance ...

await client.close()
```

Once you closed the client, it will be seen as `disconnected` and if you try to run any further queries with it, you will get a `NotConnectedToDatabase` exception.


#### Registering models <a name="registering-models"></a>
As mentioned before, the basic concept is to work with models which reflect the nodes and relationships inside the graph. In order to work with these models, you have to register them with the client. You can do this by calling the `register_models()` method on the client and passing in your models as a list. Let's take a look at an example:

```python
# Create a new client instance and connect ...

await client.register_models([Developer, Coffee, Drinks])
```

This is a crucial step, because if you don't register your models with the client, you won't be able to work with them in any way. Should you try to work with a model that is not registered with the client instance, you will get a `UnregisteredModel` exception. This exception also gets raised if a database model defines a relationship property with other (unregistered) models as a target or relationship model. For more information about relationship properties, see the [`Relationship properties on node models`](#relationship-properties-on-node-models) section.

If you have defined any indexes or constraints on your models, they will be created automatically when registering them (if not disabled when the client got initialized).

If you don't register your models with the client, you will still be able to run cypher queries directly with the client, but you will `loose automatic model resolution` from queries. This means that, instead of database models, the raw Neo4j classes are returned.


#### Executing Cypher queries <a name="executing-cypher-queries"></a>
Node- and RelationshipModels provide many methods for commonly used cypher queries, but sometimes you might want to execute a custom cypher with more complex logic. For this purpose, the client instance provides a `cypher()` method that allows you to execute custom cypher queries. The `cypher()` method takes a three arguments:

- `query`: The cypher query to execute.
- `parameters`: A dictionary containing the parameters to pass to the query.
- `resolve_models`: Whether the client should try to resolve the models from the query results. Defaults to `True`.

This method will always return a tuple containing list of result lists and a list of variables returned by the query. Internally, the client uses the `.values()` method of the Neo4j driver to get the results of the query.

> **Note:** If no models have been registered with the client and resolve_models is set to True, the client will not raise any exceptions but rather return the raw query results.

Here is an example of how to execute a custom cypher query:

```python
# Create a new client instance and connect ...

results, meta = await client.cypher(
  query="MATCH (d:Developer) WHERE d.name = $name RETURN d.name as developer_name, d.age",
  parameters={"name": "John Doe"},
  resolve_models=False, # Explicitly disable model resolution
)

print(results) # [["John Doe", 25]]
print(meta) # ["developer_name", "d.age"]
```


#### Batching cypher queries <a name="batching-cypher-queries"></a>
Since Neo4j is ACID compliant, it is possible to batch multiple cypher queries into a single transaction. This can be useful if you want to execute multiple queries at once and make sure that either all of them succeed or none of them. The client provides a `batch()` method that allows you to batch multiple cypher queries into a single transaction. The `batch()` method has to be called with a context manager like in the following example:

```python
# Create a new client instance and connect ...
# Make sure to register models when using them!

async with client.batch():
  # All queries executed inside the context manager will be batched into a single transaction
  # and executed once the context manager exits. If any of the queries fail, the whole transaction
  # will be rolled back.
  await client.cypher(
      query="CREATE (d:Developer {name: $name, age: $age})",
      parameters={"name": "John Doe", "age": 25},
  )
  await client.cypher(
      query="CREATE (c:Coffee {name: $name})",
      parameters={"name": "Espresso"},
  )

  # Model queries also can be batched together
  coffee = await Coffee(name="Americano").create()
```

#### Manual indexing and constraints <a name="working-with-indexes-and-constraints"></a>
By default, the client will automatically create any indexes and constraints defined on models when registering them. If you want to disable this behavior, you can do so by passing the `skip_indexes` and `skip_constraints` arguments to the `connect()` method when connecting to a database instance.

If you want to create custom indexes and constraints, or want to add additional indexes/constraints later on (which should probably be done on the models themselves), you can do so by calling the `create_index()` and `create_constraint()` methods on the client.

First, let's take a look at how to create a custom index in the database. The `create_index()` method takes a few arguments:

- `name`: The name of the index to create (Make sure this is unique!).
- `entity_type`: The entity type the index is created for. Can be either **EntityType.NODE** or **EntityType.RELATIONSHIP**.
- `index_type`: The type of index to create. Can be `IndexType.RANGE`, `IndexType.TEXT`, `IndexType.POINT` or `IndexType.LOOKUP`.
- `properties`: A list of properties to create the index for.
- `labels_or_type`: The node labels or relationship type the index is created for.

The `create_constraint()` method also takes similar arguments as the `create_index()` method. The only difference is that it does not take a `constraint_type` argument since only `UNIQUENESS` constraints are currently supported.

- `name`: The name of the constraint to create.
- `entity_type`: The entity type the constraint is created for. Can be either **EntityType.NODE** or **EntityType.RELATIONSHIP**.
- `properties`: A list of properties to create the index for.
- `labels_or_type`: The node labels or relationship type the index is created for.

Here is an example of how to use the methods:

```python
# Creates a `RANGE` index on the labels `Test` and `Node`
# for both properties `prop_a and prop_b`
await client.create_index("node_text_index", EntityType.NODE, IndexType.RANGE, ["prop_a", "prop_b"], ["Test", "Node"])

# Creates a UNIQUENESS constraint for properties `prop_a and prop_b`
# for all relationships of type `TEST_RELATIONSHIP`
await client.create_constraint("relationship_constraint", EntityType.RELATIONSHIP, ["prop_a", "prop_b"], "TEST_RELATIONSHIP")
```


#### Client utilities <a name="client-utilities"></a>
The database client also provides a few utility methods and properties that can be useful when writing automated scripts or tests. These methods are:

- `is_connected()`: Returns whether the client is connected to a database instance.
- `drop_nodes()`: Drops all nodes from the database.
- `drop_constraints()`: Drops all constraints from the database.
- `drop_indexes()`: Drops all indexes from the database.


### Model configuration <a name="model-configuration"></a>
Both Node- and RelationshipModels provide a few configuration options that can be used to define indexes, constraints and other settings for the model. These options can be used to easily define how nodes and relationships are created in the database.

Since this library uses `pydantic` under the hood, all of the configuration options available for pydantic models are also available for Node- and RelationshipModels. For more information about the configuration options available for pydantic models, see the [`pydantic docs`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/1.10/).


#### Defining node and relationship properties <a name="defining-node-and-relationship-properties"></a>
Node- and RelationshipModels are defined in the same way as pydantic models. The only difference is that you have to use the `NodeModel` and `RelationshipModel` classes instead of the `BaseModel` class. Here is an example of how to define a simple NodeModel:

```python
from pyneo4j_ogm import NodeModel
from pydantic import Field, validator
from uuid import UUID, uuid4

class Developer(NodeModel):
  """
  A model representing a developer node in the graph.
  """
  id: UUID = Field(default_factory=uuid4)
  name: str
  age: int
  likes_his_job: bool

  @validator("likes_his_job")
  def must_like_his_job(cls, v):
    if not v:
      raise ValueError("A developer must like his job!")
    return v
```

A node created with the above model could look like this as a cypher query:

```cypher
CREATE (d:Developer {id: "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-g7h8-i9j0-k1l2m3n4o5p6", name: "John Doe", age: 25, likes_his_job: true})
```

> **Note:** Everything mentioned above also applies to `RelationshipModels`.


#### Defining indexes and constraints on model properties <a name="defining-indexes-and-constraints-on-model-properties"></a>
This library provides a convenient way to define indexes and constraints on model properties. This can be done by using the `WithOptions` method instead of the datatype when defining the properties of your model. The `WithOptions` method takes a few arguments:

- `property_type`: The datatype of the property.
- `range_index`: Whether to create a range index on the property. Defaults to `False`.
- `text_index`: Whether to create a text index on the property. Defaults to `False`.
- `point_index`: Whether to create a point index on the property. Defaults to `False`.
- `unique`: Whether to create a uniqueness constraint on the property. Defaults to `False`.

If the method is called without defining any indexes or constraints, it behaves just like any other property. Here is an example of how to define indexes and constraints on model properties:

```python
from pyneo4j_ogm import NodeModel, WithOptions
from pydantic import Field
from uuid import UUID, uuid4

class Developer(NodeModel):
  """
  A model representing a developer node in the graph.
  """
  id: WithOptions(UUID, unique=True) = Field(default_factory=uuid4)
  name: WithOptions(str, text_index=True)
  age: int
  likes_his_job: bool
```

In the example above, we defined a `text index` on the `name` property and a `uniqueness constraint` on the `email` property. If you want to define multiple indexes or constraints on a single property, you can do so by passing multiple arguments to the `WithOptions` method. Note that you can still use the full power of pydantic like validators and default values when defining indexes and constraints on model properties.

> **Note:** Everything mentioned above also applies to `RelationshipModels`.


#### Defining settings for a model <a name="defining-settings-for-a-model"></a>
It is possible to define a number of settings for a model. These settings can be used to configure how nodes and relationships are created in the database and how you can interact with them. Settings are defined with a nested class called `Settings`. Class attributes act as the settings defined on the model. The following settings are available for Node- and RelationshipModels:

| Setting name          | Type                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `exclude_from_export` | **Set[str]**                  | Can be used to always exclude a property from being exported when using the `export_model()` method on a model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `pre_hooks`           | **Dict[str, List[Callable]]** | A dictionary where the key is the name of the method for which to register the hook and the value is a list of hook functions. The hook function can be sync or async. All hook functions receive the exact same arguments as the method they are registered for and the current model instance as the first argument. Defaults to `{}`. |
| `post_hooks`          | **Dict[str, List[Callable]]** | Same as **pre_hooks**, but the hook functions are executed after the method they are registered for. Additionally, the result of the method is passed to the hook as the second argument. Defaults to `{}`.                                                                                                                              |



##### NodeModel specific settings <a name="nodemodel-specific-settings"></a>
NodeModels have two additional setting, `labels` and `auto_fetch_nodes`.

| Setting name       | Type         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `labels`           | **Set[str]** | A set of labels to use for the node. If no labels are defined, the name of the model will be used as the label. Defaults to `None`.                                                                                                      |
| `auto_fetch_nodes` | **bool**     | Whether to automatically fetch nodes of defined relationship properties when getting a model instance from the database. Auto-fetched nodes are available at the `instance.<relationship-property>.nodes` property. Defaults to `False`. |

> **Note:** When no labels are defined for a NodeModel, the name of the model will be used and converted to **PascalCase** to stay in line with the style guide for cypher.


##### RelationshipModel specific settings <a name="relationshipmodel-specific-settings"></a>
For RelationshipModels, the `labels` setting is not available, since relationships don't have labels in Neo4j. Instead, the `type` setting can be used to define the type of the relationship. If no type is defined, the name of the model name will be used as the type.

> **Note:** When no type is defined for a RelationshipModel, the name of the model will be used and converted to **SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE** to stay in line with the style guide for cypher.


##### How to use model settings <a name="how-to-use-model-settings"></a>
Now, after we have taken a look at all of the available settings, let's take a look at how to use them:


```python
class Developer(NodeModel):
  ...

  class Settings:
    # Nodes of this model will have the labels "Developer" and "Python"
    labels = {"Developer", "Python"}
    # The "likes_his_job" property will always be excluded from being exported
    exclude_from_export = {"likes_his_job"}


def print_drink(self, result, *args, **kwargs):
  # Will print the result from the `find_one()` method
  print(result)


class Drinks(RelationshipModel):
  ...

  class Settings:
    # The type of the relationship will be "DRINKS"
    type = "DRINKS"
    # The "print_drink" method will be executed after the "find_one" method
    post_hooks = {"find_one": [print_drink]}
```


#### Model methods <a name="model-methods"></a>
Node- and RelationshipModels provide a number of methods for commonly used cypher queries. In the following sections we will take a look at all of the methods available on Node- and RelationshipModels.

> **Note:** All of the methods mentioned below are available on both Node- and RelationshipModels unless stated otherwise. If a method is defined using **Instance.method()**, the method is to be called on a instance if a model. If a method is defined using **Model.method()**, the method is to be called on the model itself.
