## Logging

You can control the log level and whether to log to the console or not by setting the `PYNEO4J_OGM_LOG_LEVEL` and `PYNEO4J_OGM_ENABLE_LOGGING` as environment variables. The available levels are the same as provided by the build-in `logging` module. The default log level is `WARNING` and logging to the console is enabled by default.
